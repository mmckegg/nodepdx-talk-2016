>> Play some tunes and give a quick overview of how it works.

# So how did this happen?

## **Recording anxiety**

> Initially I was just extending my existing tools. I really liked a lot of aspects of Native Instruments’s Maschine, however I found recording new loops on the fly to be unnecessarily difficult. I suffer from acute recording anxiety. I’m jamming away a cool riff, and it sounds awesome, then I hit record and my figures turn to jelly, and it comes out all wrong.

> So my first version was actually just a Node.js script that allowed me more control over input, storing all MIDI in a buffer, and then allowing me to go back in time and create loops after I played them, along with some realtime loop transform controls. At this stage, I was still just trying to reproduce my “studio” style music but performed live. But I managed to develop a lot of the core looping concepts that still exist in Loop Drop today.

## **How hard can it be?**

Besides, those other programs are way to complicated!

> I suppose the real reason I started trying to replace NI Maschine and Ableton Live with Web Audio was mainly just to see if I could. There were definitely things that I disliked about these programs, such as the inability to load multiple songs and mix between, converting existing songs to play live was time consuming, and I wanted to get back to basics with sound design - these big programs just do too much, and it’s way too tempting to just use the complex presets available.

## **A new way to play.**

**_"One true version"_ no more!**

> As my own MIDI looping system, and my own sound generation started to come together, I stumbled on a whole new way to play. Rather than having the “one true version” of a song, they become more like collections of ideas, moments. My performances took on a major improvisatory quality. I realised I could make “my studio process” and my “live performance” the same thing.

## My **studio process** and my **live performance** can be the **_same thing_**

> At this point I added “preroll audio recording”, which meant that Loop Drop was always recording the master output of everything you play — all you have to do is hit save. I recorded an entire album this way. It was such a refreshing change from the traditional electronic music production style where you slave over every teeny detail in a DAW. And it also means I already have my live sets ready to go!

## JavaScript the **enabler**.

A co-evolution, me and my tool.

> So it has been a co-evolution — me and my tool. I continue to tweak my code as I encounter issues / have new ideas, and those changes inform new ideas in a crazy cycle of inspiration! As it stands now, there is no way that I could go back.

> Web Audio has allowed me to discover a much more enjoyable music process, and gives my complete control over the direction I go.

## Electron is **Chromium + Node.js**

You can have **all the things**!

>> Explain what electron is, and who makes it.

# Why is Loop Drop _just_ a **desktop** application?

## The web is **restrictive**.

Disk-space, bandwidth, speed, connectivity.

> There are space limitations, speed/bandwidth issues, and you need to be online. I didn't build this app using web tech for networking, I did it because I like the platform.

>> Show how loop drop can store files directly on the users computer, record lossless wav output, and stream lossless wav from disk.

## The web **requires responsibility**.

Hosting, support, up-time. Subscriptions. Monetization. Supporting multiple browsers.

> I'm just not interested in running a cloud based startup.

> Software puts the user back in control. If I stop making loop drop, it doesn't just stop working.
